# README

This is a project I'm utilizing for diving into Ruby.

* Ruby version: ruby 2.5.1p57 (2018-03-29 revision 63029) [x86_64-linux]

Currently working on deploying this using AWS EC2 Ubuntu instance. However, it's been a pain, so I might just dockerize it deploy that with ECS attached to an ELB instead.

## Things that I'll be updating after I finish AWS deploy

* Migrate from sqlite3 to postgres

* Add user accounts
  * Sign up / Sign in / Logout
  * Random token auth sessions

* Add forums

* Add text game

* Make pretty
